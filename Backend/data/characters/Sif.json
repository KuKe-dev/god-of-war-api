  "description": "Sif (Nordic: ᛊᛁᚠ), also known as Sif Mandifarisdóttir (Translation: Sif, Daughter of Mandifari) is the Norse Goddess of Wheat, Earth, Harvest and Family. She is the second wife of Thor, the daughter-in-law of Odin, the stepmother of Magni and Modi and mother of Thrúd.\nSif is introduced as a secondary character of God of War Ragnarök. Acting as Odin's diplomat and notably managing the relations with the refugees newly established in Asgard, Sif has long been dissatisfied with the All-Father's policy regarding family matters. Her bitterness is further exacerbated as soon as Atreus settles in the room of her son, Modi, whom he killed three years ago. She unsuccessfully tries to use her influence upon her husband, Thor, by openly questioning his loyalty to Odin, whom she sees as a threat to the Aesir in general and to her family in particular. A loving mother and faithful wife, Sif survives Ragnarök and becomes the new leader of the Aesir following the death of both Odin and Thor, and ultimately settles in Vanaheim.",
