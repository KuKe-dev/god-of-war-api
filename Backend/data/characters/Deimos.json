  "name": "Deimos",
  "description": "Deimos (Greek: Δείμος) is the deuteragonist of God of War: Ghost of Sparta. He was the younger son of Zeus and Callisto, and the younger brother of Kratos. Due to his strange birthmarks, he was abducted by Ares and Athena during his childhood to avert a prophecy about the destruction of Mount Olympus at the hands of a \"Marked Warrior\". He was then tortured by Thanatos, God of Death for years in the Domain of Death. After he came of age in the Domain of Death, Deimos was fueled by hatred for the brother who had failed to save him from his torment. After Deimos was rescued by Kratos, and still held initial resentment toward him, he ultimately reconciled with his brother and joined forces with him to battle Thanatos only to be killed by the God of Death himself. That was not unavenged, however, as Kratos killed Thanatos shortly after. His death was the final straw which lead to Kratos snapping at the gods and vowing to kill them, which Kratos ultimately succeeded in doing so, inadvertently fulfilling the Marked Warrior prophecy.",
