  "name": "Brenna Banamaðr",
  "description": "\nBrenna Banamaðr is a fire troll and an optional boss in God of War Ragnarök.\nGod of War Ragnarök[]\nBrenna Banamaðr can be located in The Crater in Vanaheim just close to the domain of the Crimson Dread. He will only spawn after Kratos completes the Return of the River favor. If the Spartan engages any other enemy or immediately attacks Brenna Banamaðr then this will start the boss fight. Letting the fire troll see you can also start the battle.\nDuring the boss fight, other enemies, such as Gulon, Draugr, Gradungr and even the Crimson Dread, would randomly join in the fight, which would make the boss battle a little difficult, unless Kratos and Atreus/Freya have the appropriate gear for it and are well-prepared.\nTrivia[]\nBrenna Banamaðr means \"Fire Killer\" or \"Fire Slayer\".\nHe is the only Norse monster to not be included in the Codex's Bestiary after being killed. The reason why is currently unknown.\nHis design and appearance is identical to Dauði Hammar and Dauði Munr respectively.",
