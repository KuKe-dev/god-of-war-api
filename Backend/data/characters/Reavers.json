  "description": "\nReavers are raiders that are among the few remaining humans in Midgard, who have not fled or had gone into hiding during the Great Desolation.\nWhile some Reavers focused on cannibalism, as evident by the ones that had made their lair in the Jötnar Marketplace, others focused on other atrocities such as hunting, reaving, pillaging, robbery, violence, etc.\nSome reavers are also known to practice Seiðr magic, which would corrupt them as well as alter their appearance, making them more aggressive. Reavers that have died may also return as undead Hel-Walkers. These reaver variants appear as common enemies in God of War (2018) and God of War: Ragnarök.",
