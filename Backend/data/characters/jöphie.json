It was a smart and loyal bird that she had by her side for years.  When Kratos was gone hunting. Laufey and Atreus would play with each other and she would call to Jöphie, her trustworthy pet. Atreus would try to call her but she won't come to him. She would only when Laufey called her. After Laufey's death she hid somewhere.\nTrivia[]\nFaye had a gyrfalcon named Jöphie.
