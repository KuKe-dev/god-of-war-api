  "description": "\nKratos fighting his ghost in God of War: Ghost of Sparta.\nKratos' Ghost was a character who briefly appeared in God of War: Ghost of Sparta.\nGod of War: Ghost of Sparta[]\nWhen Kratos looked upon a mirror in the Temple of Ares, his reflection immediately changed in appearance. As Kratos reached his hand out toward his reflection, his reflection tried to pull him into the mirror.\nKratos succeeded in pulling his hand away from the mirror, only to see his reflection change into his younger self. The Ghost then escaped the mirror, charged at Kratos, and then beat him furiously. After Kratos threw the ghost in several directions, he attempted to push the ghost back into the mirror, which succeeded in destroying both the mirror and the reflection itself. Kratos retrieved The Skull of Keres from the hole where the mirror was and made his way back to Atlantis in order to open the portal to the Domain of Death.",
