In the battle against Herodius, Nikos was injured, but nevertheless still alive. Hades, worried that Kratos may stand a chance against his champion, sent fires through the sky, burning half the Spartan army and killing Nikos, who died trying to save Kratos. With his last words, Nikos granted Kratos his position as captain. Years later, during Kratos' second journey for the ambrosia, Nikos, along with all the other fallen Kratos abandoned, returns as corpse seeking vengeance against Kratos, but Kratos repelled them and sent them back toÂ Hades.\nTrivia[]\nIt is possible that Nikos was named after the Goddess of Victory, Nike.",
