  "description": "Ragnarök, also known as Ragnarøkkr (Old Norse for Twilight of the Gods), is a major event first prophesied by the Jötunn Gróa that foresaw the ultimate battle that results in the death of many Gods, including Odin and Thor, as well as the \"rebirth\" of the world through submersion into water. Kratos and Atreus were also mentioned in the prophecy, as being the center of everything. However, in truth, it will only result in the destruction of Asgard while the other Realms will continue to thrive while intact.",
