However, Kratos merely moved her aside and went on to kill all those inside the temple, including his beloved wife Lysandra and his daughter Calliope, who had been placed at the temple by Ares, the God of War. The oracle then laughed spitefully at the grieving Kratos, who was cradling the bodies of his slaughtered family.\nAfter Kratos had exited the building and cursed Ares for his actions, the oracle had proclaimed that \"From this night forward, the mark of your terrible deed will be visible to all. The ashes of your wife, and child will remain fastened to your skin. Never to be removed.\" With that curse the ashes of his deceased family would permanently cover his skin. This explained the origin of Kratos' infamous nickname \"The Ghost of Sparta\", and thus set forth the events that came later on in the series.\nGallery[]\n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/7/73/Village_Oracle_2.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20080716032331\" title=\"Village Oracle 2.jpg (44 KB)\" class=\"thumbimage\" alt=\"The Village Oracle at the temple\" height=\"185\" width=\"185\" data-image-name=\"Village Oracle 2.jpg\" data-image-key=\"Village_Oracle_2.jpg\" data-relevant=\"1\" data-caption=\"The Village Oracle at the temple\">The Village Oracle at the temple<img style=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/6/61/VillageOracleinAscension.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20250411135708\" title=\"VillageOracleinAscension.png (3.59 MB)\" class=\"thumbimage\" alt=\"Tisiphone&#39;s illusion\" height=\"185\" width=\"185\" data-image-name=\"VillageOracleinAscension.png\" data-image-key=\"VillageOracleinAscension.png\" data-relevant=\"1\" data-caption=\"Tisiphone&#39;s illusion\">Tisiphone's illusion<img style=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/e/ed/VillageOracle.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/118?cb=20140926173735\" title=\"VillageOracle.jpg (372 KB)\" class=\"thumbimage\" alt=\"\" height=\"185\" width=\"185\" data-image-name=\"VillageOracle.jpg\" data-image-key=\"VillageOracle.jpg\" data-relevant=\"1\">\nTrivia[]\nThe 24th Greek letter \"Omega\" that the Oracle carries around her neck is also the symbol that appears on the front cover of all the games in the God of War series, what could be foreshadowing that Kratos is the \"end\" for the gods.\nShe is voiced by Susanne Blakeslee, the actress who also portrays the Oracle of Athens and later Gaia in God of War III.\nShe was seen briefly in God Of War: Ascension, when Tisiphone disguised herself as the Village Oracle, saying: They were not there by chance, Kratos, before Kratos kills Tisiphone.\nIt is unknown why Kratos did not simply kill her as he had brutally done so with the other village inhabitants. Instead, he calmly moved her aside.\nIt is unknown why Kratos didn't use his powers to remove the ashes once he became a god.",
