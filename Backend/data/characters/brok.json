  "name": "Brok",
  "description": "Brok, also known as Brokkr, is a character in God of War (2018). He is a Dwarf, along with his brother Sindri. He and his brother used to work together until a rift between differing views caused the family business to split in two. The pair were responsible for forging Thor's hammer, Mjölnir, and Kratos' axe, Leviathan, which formerly belonged to Laufey.\nSindri and Brok aided Kratos and Atreus during their adventures and serve as comic relief. In their forge, they can improve weapons and equipment, so long as they are given the necessary materials.",
