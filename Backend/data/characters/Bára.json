  "description": "\nNorse Mythology[]\nBára (sometimes called Drǫfn) Was one of nine daughters (\"billow maidens\") of the Jötunn Ægir, and the Goddess Rán in the Northern mythology, each name reflecting a different characteristic of ocean waves.\nIn God of War series[]\nGod of War Ragnarök[]\nWhen Angrboda shows Loki the Jötnar marbles, the latter takes out one of Bára's, and then when Angrboda explains what happened to the Giants and she interacts a little with Bára's soul. It is unknown what the cause of his death was or if he did not die before the souls of the Giants were taken to the marbles by Angrboda's father.\nIt's also unconfirmed whether or not Bára is actually one of the Nine Daughters of Ægir and Rán, or just a different giant with a similar name.",
