Because of this, they are often looked down upon by most of the other mythical races in the world especially by the Gods, who either choose to ignore them completely or else use them as cattle. It is possible that Prometheus fashioned them out of clay from the Grecian soils.\nIronically, Kratos, considered by many to be the most dangerous of the Greek Gods, was born mortal.",
