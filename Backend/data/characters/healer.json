  "description": "The Healer is a mysterious character who appeared in God of War (comics).\nHistory[]\nOn his first quest for the Ambrosia, Kratos encountered a mysterious healer who aided him in his quest. While making his way through a cave, Kratos came across the healer, who told him he would not succeed in his quest to save Calliope. Angered by his statement, Kratos grabbed the healer by the throat, who held Kratos back by giving him the Flames of Apollo. He warned Kratos the Flames would only aid him, not protect him, but his warnings were disregarded by Kratos. He quietly told Kratos that it was in fact the Gods he should fear.\nTrivia[]\nThe healer's behavior with Kratos seems to indicate he is Zeus in disguise.\nA major hint is that he referred to Kratos as \"my foolish son\".\nIf he is Zeus this would make him the first mortal disguise Zeus created aside from the Grave Digger who (chronologically) appeared after the events in the comics.\nIt also would make sense for him to be Apollo since he, besides Asclepius, is the God of Healing, so him having the disguise of someone known as \"The Healer\" would fit under one of his godly titles.\nHis warning to Kratos also came off as a sign of worry, not as a threat.",
