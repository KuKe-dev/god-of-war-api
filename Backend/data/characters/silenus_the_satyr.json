  "name": "Silenus the Satyr",
  "description": "Greek Mythology[]\nSilenus the Satyr is the servant of the God of Wine, Dionysus. Once, Dionysus discovered that Silenus was missing. It was then revealed that the old satyr had been drinking wine and had wandered away drunk, later to be found by some Phrygian peasants, who carried him to their king, Midas (alternatively, he passed out in Midas' rose garden). Midas recognized him and treated him hospitably, entertaining him for ten days and nights with politeness, while Silenus delighted Midas and his friends with stories and songs.\nOn the eleventh day, he brought Silenus back to Dionysus in Lydia. Dionysus offered Midas his choice of whatever reward he wished for. Midas asked that whatever he might touch should be changed into gold.\nMidas rejoiced in his new power, but soon found it to be a curse, as even his own daughter was turned to gold by his touch.\nGod of War: Ghost of Sparta[]\nAlthough not appearing in the game physically, the Satyr was referenced when Kratos discovered the origin of Midas' golden touch.",
