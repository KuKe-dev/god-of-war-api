  "name": "Týr",
  "description": "Týr (Old Norse: Tyrr, Nordic: ᛏᛁᚱ) is the Aesir God of War, Law, Justice, and Honor.\nFollowing a spiritual awakening, he gave up his role as the God of War, embarked on a journey of introspection, and changed his position to one of peace. Týr was imprisoned by Odin. After the death of Odin and the destruction of Asgard, he was freed by Kratos and Freya.\nWith the defeat of Odin, it was later decided to make a council to rule the Nine Realms instead of being controlled by one All-Father. Týr decided that it would be for the best that Kratos should be part of the newly formed council and represent as the God of War. As Týr invited Kratos to Valhalla to help him face his past and future, Kratos eventually agreed to be part of the council.\nWith his mission complete, Týr would once again leave the Nine Realms and set out on his own journey.",
