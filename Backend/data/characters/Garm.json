  "description": "Garm (Nordic: ᚵᚨᛗᛦ), also known Hróðvitnir (Nordic: ᚼᚱᚢᚦᚠᛁᛏᚾᛁᛦ) by the Aesir and Fenrir (Nordic: ᚠᛖᚾᚱᛁᚱ) after death, was a giant monstrous wolf that was imprisoned in Helheim. Between Garm's ability to create tears between realms and eat entire metaphysical concepts, its lack of a soul, and its vicious, feral nature, it was imprisoned by the Aesir god Týr in Helheim, where it remained for centuries before being released by Atreus due to his ignorance of Garm's nature. To prevent Garm from tearing apart the realms, Atreus and Kratos defeated the creature and transferred the soul of their recently deceased pet wolf Fenrir into Garm's body, changing him into Fenrir's reincarnation. Garm is the father of Sköll and Hati.",
