  "name": "Captain",
  "description": "“\n\nTo perform an act so heartless and to put it out of one's mind, to never speak of it... It reminds me of a captain I wronged long ago. He too was robbed of his freedom and suffered because of who I was and the choices I made. Perhaps there is a measure of monster inside us all.\n\n”\n\n\n–Kratos.\nThe Captain was the leading sailor of a fleet of ships that once sailed the Aegean Sea during the events of God of War, when Kratos was tasked with killing the Hydra King as part of his service to the Gods of Olympus. However, despite being momentarily saved from falling into the Hydra's stomach by Kratos, the warrior only did so to obtain the key he had on him before letting him fall to his death inside the creature's carcass.\nHe is a minor but recurring character in the series where he is usually seen as a resident of the Underworld or simply mentioned as he laments his death at Kratos' hands. Even many years after his death, Kratos still remembers how he wronged the man and shows regret at his selfish and unsympathetic personality back in his younger days.",
