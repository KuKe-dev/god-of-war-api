  "description": "\nMiklimunnr  is a fire troll that appears as an optional boss in God of War Ragnarök.\nBiography[]\nSometime after Kratos and Atreus had freed Týr, who is actually Odin in disguise, from his prison in The Applecore mines, Miklimunnr arrived at said location some time and decided to make it his home.\nGod of War Ragnarök[]\nIf Kratos and Atreus/Freya returns to the prison which formerly held the fake Týr, Miklimunnr, having already sensed their presence, immediately rushes out to kill them. Unfortunately for the fire troll, he ended up facing defeat at their hands, which also resulted in his death.\nTrivia[]\nMiklimunnr's design and appearance is the same as Brenna Dauði.\nLike Brenna Dauði, Miklimunnr reveals himself by rushing in and slamming his fire totem to the ground.",
