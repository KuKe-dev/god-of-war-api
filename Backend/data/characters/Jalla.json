  "name": "Jalla",
  "description": "Jalla is a yak that accompanies the giantess Angrboda that she rides when she does her daily routine of feeding the soulless animals her grandmother Grýla created in Ironwood. It is very clear and apparent, Angrboda is great friends with all of her animal friends she cares for, but Jalla is rather special to her. You can tell there is a great bond even on Jalla's part by the way we get to see them briefly interact in specific scenes.",
