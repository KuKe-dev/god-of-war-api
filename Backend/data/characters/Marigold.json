  "description": "Marigold was the daughter of King Midas.\nGreek Mythology\nIn myth, Marigold (Zoe by some accounts was her name) was the daughter of Midas, a king who was given the power to turn anything into gold with his touch. Unfortunately, she too was turned to gold. Because of this, Midas despised his accursed power and sought help from the God of Wine, Dionysus. With his help, Midas was able to turn everything he made into gold normal, even his daughter.\nIn the God of War Series\nGhost of Sparta\nAfter entering the Canyons of Sorrow, Kratos encountered Marigold, who was turned to gold by her father's touch. As Kratos examined her body, the origin of Midas' power was revealed to him. Later, Kratos encountered Midas, who was weeping and mourning the loss of his beloved daughter. Kratos killed Midas in order to cross a river of lava, and Marigold's golden form was left in the caves.",
