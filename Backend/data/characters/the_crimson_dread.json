  "description": "\nThe Crimson Dread is an optional boss introduced in God of War: Ragnar√∂k.\nIt is fought in the Vanaheim Crater during the quest to rescue Birgir.\nDescription[]\nThe Crimson Dread is a red dragon that uses a variety of close-range attacks, as well as fire attacks. Several times throughout the fight, the dragon will fly into the air and spit fire as it flies over you. It will continue to do this until you knock it down, so use your Draupnir Spear and throw it at the dragon's head to bring it down, giving you an opportunity to deal damage.\nGallery[]\n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/e/e2/Hq720_%287%29.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20241218174028\" title=\"Hq720 (7).jpg (106 KB)\" class=\"thumbimage\" alt=\"\" height=\"104\" width=\"185\" data-image-name=\"Hq720 (7).jpg\" data-image-key=\"Hq720_%287%29.jpg\" data-relevant=\"1\"><img style=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/8/82/Hq720_%286%29.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20241218174028\" title=\"Hq720 (6).jpg (79 KB)\" class=\"thumbimage\" alt=\"\" height=\"104\" width=\"185\" data-image-name=\"Hq720 (6).jpg\" data-image-key=\"Hq720_%286%29.jpg\" data-relevant=\"1\">",
