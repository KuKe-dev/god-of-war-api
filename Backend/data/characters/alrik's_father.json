The King was suffering from the \"living sleep\", which locked him in the Land of Morpheus until his life drained away.\nin a desperate attempt to save him, Alrik ventured forth on a quest for the healing drink of the gods, Ambrosia, having been informed of its abilities by an elder.\nAlrik failed however, as the Spartan warrior Kratos (the champion of Ares) captured the Ambrosia to save his daughter from an innate illness. Returning home empty handed, Alrik saw his father, who had succumbed to his illness, being cremated. Having been crowned the new Barbarian King shortly after, Alrik vowed vengeance on Kratos.",
