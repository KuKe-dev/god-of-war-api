  "name": "Vísi Haglkorn",
  "description": "\nVísi Haglkorn is an ice troll that appears in God of War Ragnarök as an optional boss Kratos can fight.\nBiography[]\nVísi Haglkorn was noted by Kratos in his journal as when the winds had blown the Ice Troll's stinky smell to the farthest parts of Midgard, he can smell the stench before he even noticed the troll. When the Spartan also noted that he and his son are running out of Trolls to fight, it's possibly that Vísi Haglkorn is now the last of the ice trolls.\nGod of War Ragnarök[]\nHe can be encountered in the Lake of Nine at the Realm travel tower of Vanaheim. He can be found in a kneeling position but will attack if provoked or when Kratos comes too close. Vísi Haglkorn was ultimately defeated and slayed, thus marking the possible extinction of the Ice Troll tribe and possibly all other Trolls, save for the Stone Troll tribes.\nTrivia[]\nThe word Vísi means \"Leader\" or \"Chief\", and the word Haglkorn means \"Hailstone\".\nHis name translates around the words of \"Hailstone Chief\" or \"Hailstone Leader\".\nVísi Haglkorn is the only ice troll that can be encountered in Midgard.\nHis appearance is the same as the Stonebeard King.",
