  "description": "Oracle Seeker\nGod of War: Ascension\n\nIn God of War: Ascension[]\nThe Oracle Seeker is encountered right before Kratos battles the Manticore in Delphi. He seems to be insane or have been driven mad by his search for the oracle of Delphi. Right before the Oracle Seeker dies, he trips and three apples fall out of his back satchel. He quickly gathers them and states that he intends to offer them to the oracle. He was quickly eliminated by the Manticore, as it took him into its jaws and beat him mercilessly against the ground before scorching him with fire breath and ultimately sent him plummeting from the mountains of Delphi. The oracle seeker's fate is unknown, but he is most likely deceased due to the viciousness of the Manticore's attacks and his subsequent fall.\nTrivia[]\nIt is unknown why the Oracle Seeker sought the oracle of Delphi.\nIt could be that he broke a bond with The Furies and sought the oracle to see how he could escape their punishment. If this man did break a bond with the Furies and survived the damage from the Manticore and the fall from its mouth, he most likely would be taken to the Prison of the Damned to suffer eternal torture. This is only an indication or educated guess.\nHad the Oracle Seeker made it to the temple of Delphi he would have probably been sent away by Pollux and Castor as his gift were mere apples and would have been considered to be not enough.\nHe also could be slain by the twins or the slaves if he would refuse to leave on his own, since he did not appear to be a warrior.\nGallery[]\n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/b/b6/Manticore_feast.JPG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20130308164558\" title=\"Manticore feast.JPG (19 KB)\" class=\"thumbimage\" alt=\"Seeker&#39;s demise\" height=\"185\" width=\"185\" data-image-name=\"Manticore feast.JPG\" data-image-key=\"Manticore_feast.JPG\" data-relevant=\"1\" data-caption=\"Seeker&#39;s demise\">Seeker's demise<img style=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/8/8b/The_Hiker.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20140828083417\" title=\"The Hiker.jpg (69 KB)\" class=\"thumbimage\" alt=\"In-game model: The Oracle Seeker (God of War: Ascension)\" height=\"185\" width=\"185\" data-image-name=\"The Hiker.jpg\" data-image-key=\"The_Hiker.jpg\" data-relevant=\"1\" data-caption=\"In-game model: The Oracle Seeker (&lt;i&gt;God of War: Ascension&lt;/i&gt;)\">In-game model: The Oracle Seeker (God of War: Ascension)<img style=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/1/13/Hiker1_SamSharit.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/170?cb=20140828083331\" title=\"Hiker1 SamSharit.jpg (437 KB)\" class=\"thumbimage\" alt=\"T-model: Oracle Seeker (God of War: Ascension)\" height=\"185\" width=\"185\" data-image-name=\"Hiker1 SamSharit.jpg\" data-image-key=\"Hiker1_SamSharit.jpg\" data-relevant=\"1\" data-caption=\"T-model: Oracle Seeker (&lt;i&gt;God of War: Ascension&lt;/i&gt;)\">T-model: Oracle Seeker (God of War: Ascension)<img style=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/3/31/GOWA-Traveller.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/93?cb=20140909074936\" title=\"GOWA-Traveller.jpg (223 KB)\" class=\"thumbimage\" alt=\"\" height=\"185\" width=\"185\" data-image-name=\"GOWA-Traveller.jpg\" data-image-key=\"GOWA-Traveller.jpg\" data-relevant=\"1\">",
