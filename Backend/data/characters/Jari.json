  "description": "\nIn the God of War Series[]\nJari was raised as a Midgardian warrior which meant his destiny was to fight in his family's war, find a wife and die in glory. Jari rejected his destiny, however, and instead set out travelling the Nine Realms. He travelled in search for something he could not explain, but could find nothing that satisfied him, until he one met another wanderer, Sómr. Less lonely, they bonded and decided to travel together, making legendary meals with other natives across the Nine realms. Over time, the pair discovered they cared less about their destinations, and more simply travelling in each other's company, and that after so many travels, what they both had searched for was a home, which they finally found by loving one another. It is said they shared their first kiss on the fields of Jötunheim, which the pair somehow managed to gain access to.\nTheir story became the subject of The Ballad of Jari and Sómr, a story which remained fondly remembered long after the pair passed away, with Mimir describing it as \"an old tale, but a good one\".\nA journal belonging to the two can be found at The Eternal Campfire in Midgard, containing a recipe for one of their meals. Picking up the journal starts the favor Across the Realms.\nBehind the scenes[]\nJari and Sómr are based on Santa Monica developers Jake Snipes and Sam Handrick. The pair were in a romantic relationship until Jake's passing in 2020, with The Ballad of Jari and Sómr and the favor Across The Realms added to the game in tribute to their relationship.\nGallery[]\n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/e/e3/S%C3%B3rm-and-Jari-tribute.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/123?cb=20240207205800\" title=\"Sórm-and-Jari-tribute.jpg (219 KB)\" class=\"thumbimage\" alt=\"\" height=\"185\" width=\"185\" data-image-name=\"Sórm-and-Jari-tribute.jpg\" data-image-key=\"S%C3%B3rm-and-Jari-tribute.jpg\" data-relevant=\"1\">",
