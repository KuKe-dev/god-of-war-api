  "description": "Kólga\nNine Daughters of Ægir and Rán\n\nNorse Mythology[]\nKólga means \"Cool-wave.\" In Norse mythology, the Goddess Rán and the Jötunn Ægir both personify the sea, and together they have nine daughters who personify waves. Each daughter's name reflects poetic terms for waves. The sisters are attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the Prose Edda, composed in the 13th century; and in the poetry of skalds. Scholars have theorized that these daughters may be the same figures as the nine mothers of the god Heimdallr. In Norse Mythology Heimdall is the child of the Nine Daughters of Ægir and Rán and the God Odin.\nIn the God of War Series[]\nKólga is one of the daughters of Ægir and Rán.  Kólga has eight known sisters, Blóðughadda, Bylgja, Drǫfn, Dúfa, Hefring, Himinglæva, Hrǫnn and Unnr. The daughters were referenced in the Lake of Nine. It is currently unconfirmed if they are the mother's to Heimdall, and if his father is Odin like they are in Norse Mythology.\nTrivia[]\nIn mythology, Kólga, along with all their sisters gave birth to Heimdall at once.",
