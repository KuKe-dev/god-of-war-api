  "name": "Lysandra",
  "description": "Lysandra (Greek: Λυσάνδρα) was a Spartan woman who was Kratos' first wife and mother to his daughter, Calliope. Though Kratos had many women in his time, he felt truly connected to Lysandra and considered her his soul mate and true love. Lysandra was also the only person who did not fear Kratos during his time as a brutal Spartan captain, and, on more than one occasion, questioned his reasons for the reckless slaughter of many innocent people.",
