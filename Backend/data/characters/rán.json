  "description": "\nRán is the Goddess of the Sea, wife of Ægir.\nNorse Mythology[]\nRán (Old Norse: [ˈrɒːn]) is a goddess and a personification of the sea. Rán and her husband Ægir, a jötunn who also personifies the sea, have nine daughters, who personify waves. The goddess is frequently associated with a net, which she uses to capture sea-goers. According to the prose introduction to a poem in the Poetic Edda and in Völsunga saga, Rán once loaned her net to the god Loki.\nRán is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled during the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the Prose Edda, written during the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; in both Völsunga saga and Friðþjófs saga hins frœkna; and in the poetry of skalds, such as Sonatorrek, a 10th-century poem by Icelandic skald Egill Skallagrímsson.\nIn a version of Norse Mythology she is the sister of Odin's wife Fjörgyn and Freya's mother Nerthus making her Odin's sister-in-law, Thor's aunt and the aunt to Freya & Freyr.\nIn the God of War Series[]\nRán married Ægir and together they had nine daughters: Blóðughadda, Bylgja, Drǫfn, Dúfa, Hefring, Himinglæva, Hrǫnn, Kólga and Unnr.\n",
