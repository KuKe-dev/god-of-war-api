The Spartan follows her but notices Lysandra's ring and thus pushes her away; the environment changes and Tisiphone prepares to fight, however, before the brawl can start Megaera claims that Kratos is hers and attacks him. This is the first time in the series that Kratos does not have a sexual act with any woman present in the game.\nChains of Olympus\n“\n\nIs there anything we can do to repay you?\n\n”\n\n\n–One of the twins after Kratos encounters them.\n<a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/2/25/God-of-war-sex.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100414110125\" class=\"mw-file-description image\"><img alt=\"God-of-war-sex\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/2/25/God-of-war-sex.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20100414110125\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"170\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"God-of-war-sex.jpg\" data-image-key=\"God-of-war-sex.jpg\" data-relevant=\"1\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/2/25/God-of-war-sex.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20100414110125\" /></a>\nIn God of War: Chains of Olympus, Kratos comes across female twins in a side chamber of the Stronghold of Attica, after having defeated the Persian King.\nThe Attica twins had apparently been threatened and forced to remain in the room. During the sexual act, a candle can be seen moving around, reacting to Kratos' and the twins' actions.\nThe second time Kratos encounters a topless woman is in the Caves of Olympus, and the woman was Eos, the Titanic Goddess of Dawn.\nGod of War\n“\n\nCome back!\n\n”\n\n\n–One of the women, after Kratos leaves.\n<a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/9/96/GodofWarSex.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20100414110653\" class=\"mw-file-description image\"><img alt=\"GodofWarSex\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/9/96/GodofWarSex.PNG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20100414110653\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"238\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"GodofWarSex.PNG\" data-image-key=\"GodofWarSex.PNG\" data-relevant=\"1\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/9/96/GodofWarSex.PNG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20100414110653\" /></a>\nIn God of War, two women are seen in Kratos's bedchambers of his ship. Kratos must climb on top of the bed in order to cause the minigame otherwise he would reject their advances. During the sexual act, a vase can be seen reacting to the rocking of the boat, and eventually shatter on the floor when Kratos completes the minigame. Later, in the opening sequence of God of War II, the twins appear at Kratos's feet, near his Throne of War acting as his consorts.\nThe dialogue between Kratos and the women can be heard, with them beckoning Kratos to stay, and him shrugging their temptations off. In the novel, their role is slightly extended. They are revealed to be twins, named Zora and Lora, and are daughters of Aphrodite, goddess of love and beauty.\nIn the God of War Collection, completing the sex minigame with them unlocks the \"Rockin' the Boat\" bronze trophy.\nGhost of Sparta\n“\n\nLord Kratos, come and play with us.\n\n”\n\n\n–One of the women at the entrance.\n<a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/2/26/Spartan_Women.png/revision/latest?cb=20101123065434\" class=\"mw-file-description image\"><img alt=\"Spartan Women\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/2/26/Spartan_Women.png/revision/latest?cb=20101123065434\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"244\" height=\"181\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Spartan Women.png\" data-image-key=\"Spartan_Women.png\" data-relevant=\"1\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/2/26/Spartan_Women.png/revision/latest?cb=20101123065434\" /></a> \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\tThe two women in Sparta\nIn God of War: Ghost of Sparta, after Kratos kills Erinys he enters his hometown of Sparta. There on his way to his old home, he comes across the brothel, where he is invited inside by two women. Kratos joins them inside and throws them onto a bed and has sex with them. Soon other women get excited and two more join in on the action, followed by another four coming in pairs for a total of eight. During the sexual activity, the bed that Kratos and the women are in begins to shake, slightly at first, but as the action reaches its peak, the bed shakes violently. If Kratos successfully completes the game he is rewarded with Red Orbs. If he has sex with them three times, he will acquire the Godly Possession, Aphrodite's Ambrosia.\nGod of War II\n“\n\nPraise the Gods.\n\n”\n\n\n–One of the women.\n<a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/b/b7/Bathhousegirls1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080716171650\" class=\"mw-file-description image\"><img alt=\"Bathhousegirls1\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/b/b7/Bathhousegirls1.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20080716171650\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Bathhousegirls1.jpg\" data-image-key=\"Bathhousegirls1.jpg\" data-relevant=\"1\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/b/b7/Bathhousegirls1.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20080716171650\" /></a>\nIn God of War II, Kratos finds two topless ladies behind a breakable wall in the Rhodes Bathhouse, just after his first encounter with the Colossus of Rhodes. During the sexual act, a statue of a peeing boy (a reference to the Belgian Manneken Pis) is seen. In the guide of God of War II, their names are revealed to be Persephone and Leda.\nGod of War III\n“\n\nNow, I ask you again, Kratos, will you stay?\n\n”\n\n\n–Aphrodite\nIn God of War III, during his travels across the Upper Gardens, Kratos finds Aphrodite in her chambers having sex with her handmaidens. He has a brief conversation with her, where she bemoans the sorry state of the bridges outside, as it prevents any men from visiting her.\nShe claims that Daedalus is too busy on Zeus' project to fix them and that only her \"worthless\" husband Hephaestus knows how to operate them, all while rolling around her bed provocatively. She asks Kratos to stay with her. Kratos would be given a choice by Aphrodite if she could have sex with him, it depends on the player if he\\she would initiate the mini-game. If the player chooses \"Yes\" the mini-game would begin, while Aphrodite's handmaidens watch them from close by, and ultimately get so aroused that they start making love as well. After the mini-game, Aphrodite rewards Kratos with Red Orbs.\nIn Poseidon's Chamber, you meet Poseidon's Princess. She is topless for her entire appearance in the game. She runs away from Kratos, begging him not to kill her.\nTrivia\nIn Ghost of Sparta, one of the women made a reference to the website Spartans Stand Tall, by saying \"Spartans really do stand tall!\"\nLeda is also the name of a Spartan queen who by Zeus became the mother of Helen, whose running away with Paris of Troy resulted in the 10-year-long Trojan War.\nGhost of Sparta has the most amount of women Kratos has sex with, a total of eight. God of War III has the least amount, only having sex with Aphrodite, while all the other games he has sex with two.\nThe Ghost of Sparta sex mini-game gives the most amount of red orbs. \nIn God of War III, Kratos has a unique thrusting animation for the minigame, it can only be seen via the use of glitches. \nIn God of War II, the character models of Zora and Lora in the intro cutscene is reused from the censored Japanese version of the first God of War. \nAscension, Betrayal, God of War (2018), and God of War Ragnarök, are to date the only games in the series not to have a sex minigame.\nIn the Japanese version, the women are not naked as they wore undergarments due to censorship.\nThis even applies to the enemies like the Gorgons and Harpies\nGallery\n<img style=\"\"
