  "name": "Eurybiades",
  "description": "Eurybiades.\nEurybiades was the leader of the Athenian Army in charge of the Greek navy during the a siege to the city of Attica.\nGod of War: Chains of Olympus[]\nIn the very beginning of God of War: Chains of Olympus, Eurybiades is found severely wounded upon a rooftop in Attica, after a ballista shot from the Persian Fleet hits him and his army. He attempts to fire back at the Persian ships with the nearby ballista but is too weak to do so. He points out to Kratos that the ballista is loaded by doing so. Eurybiades dies because of his injuries.\nTrivia[]\nThere's two facts that point out that this wasn't the Eurybiades that fought in the Greco-Persian Wars. Firstly, this character is listed as the leader of the Athenian Army, while Eurybiades was actually a Spartan commander. Secondly, this character dies during the war, while Eurybiades historically survived the wars. This would mean that this character was actually named after the Spartan commander.",
