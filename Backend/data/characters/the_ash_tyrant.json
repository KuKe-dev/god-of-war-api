  "description": "\nThe Ash Tyrant is a boss introduced in God of War: Ragnar√∂k.\nDescription[]\nThe Ash Tyrant is a white dragon that uses a variety of melee attacks, as well as fire attacks. This dragon is quite unique compared to the other dragons you fight, as the mechanics are completely different. It will do some melee attacks, but for the most part, it will attack with fire. When the dragon tries to breathe fire, a weak spot will appear on its neck, which, when attacked with a spear or axe, will instantly stun the dragon, allowing you to deal a lot of damage. At two intervals throughout the fight, the dragon will fly away and land on one of the columns in the area, spawning Draugr and Wyverns. You will need to defeat all of these mob enemies (or kill them with the dragon's fire attacks), after which you will be able to destroy the column the dragon is standing on. Every now and then, the dragon will fly up and fall down, but you cannot make it collapse like other dragons. As long as you focus on dodging the fire, this dragon should not pose much of a problem.\nGallery[]\n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/f/f5/Ashtyre2.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20241218174223\" title=\"Ashtyre2.jpg (67 KB)\" class=\"thumbimage\" alt=\"\" height=\"104\" width=\"185\" data-image-name=\"Ashtyre2.jpg\" data-image-key=\"Ashtyre2.jpg\" data-relevant=\"1\"><img style=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/8/82/Hq720_%282%29.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20241218174027\" title=\"Hq720 (2).jpg (93 KB)\" class=\"thumbimage\" alt=\"\" height=\"104\" width=\"185\" data-image-name=\"Hq720 (2).jpg\" data-image-key=\"Hq720_%282%29.jpg\" data-relevant=\"1\"><img style=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/6/69/Hq720_%284%29.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20241218174028\" title=\"Hq720 (4).jpg (103 KB)\" class=\"thumbimage\" alt=\"\" height=\"104\" width=\"185\" data-image-name=\"Hq720 (4).jpg\" data-image-key=\"Hq720_%284%29.jpg\" data-relevant=\"1\"><img style=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/7/75/Hq720_%283%29.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/185?cb=20241218174027\" title=\"Hq720 (3).jpg (72 KB)\" class=\"thumbimage\" alt=\"\" height=\"104\" width=\"185\" data-image-name=\"Hq720 (3).jpg\" data-image-key=\"Hq720_%283%29.jpg\" data-relevant=\"1\">",
