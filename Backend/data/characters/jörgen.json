  "description": "Jörgen is a minor character who appears in God of War Ragnarök. Little is known about him, except that he is an Asgardian resident and possible cook for the Aesir Gods. Jörgen is encountered during Atreus' visit to Asgard, where Odin will casually strike up one-sided conversation with him and warn against the use of mushrooms in his meals.\nIt is unknown whether or not he survived the subsequent destruction of the realm during Ragnarök.\nIn \"God of War' series[]\nAfter Atreus and Odin arrive at The Great Lodge again, they are soon approached by Jörgen, delivering a stack of books to Atreus upon Odin's orders. Later, he can be seen talking with Lady Sif near the entrance of the Lodge. Much later, he can be seen again - cutting some breads.\nTrivia[]",
