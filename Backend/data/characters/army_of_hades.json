  "name": "Army of Hades",
  "description": "The Army of Hades was power that was given to Kratos by Hades, after he slain Pandora's Guardian and acquired the Architect's Son's Head. It allowed Kratos to summon the Souls of Hades, and made them attack his enemies. A player could also level it up to increase the power and amount of the souls. Kratos used a variant of that power in God of War: Ascension when he defeated and acquired the Soul of Hades. Kratos used a variant of that power in God of War II when he defeated the Barbarian King, Alrik, and acquired the Barbarian Hammer. Kratos used a variant of that power in God of War III when he defeated Hades and acquired the Claws of Hades.",
