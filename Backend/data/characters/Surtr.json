  "name": "Surtr",
  "description": "Surtr, also known as Surt, is the first and last fire Giant as well as the second being in existence to be born. He was the ruler of Muspelheim and the fire giants. He was hidden deep within his realm, and was constantly training and honing his skills to be prepared for Ragnarök, in which he will lead his kin against the Aesir and destroy Asgard, and is also destined to die at the hands of Thor and Odin, but despite his defeat he will be taking down Asgard with him in the process so the cycle of life can be reborn.\nHowever, the lore is later revealed to be a lie as Surtr is actually destined to become Ragnarök, the apocalypse itself, but still has to fulfil his purpose in destroying Asgard, while sparing the rest of the realms from destruction.",
